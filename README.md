# The Pocket: A Human-AI Co-Design Platform for AI Systems

> Build enterprise-ready AI systems—fast, modular, and vendor-agnostic.

## Why The Pocket?
Modern enterprises need automation—yet a single LLM call rarely cuts it. Complex tasks require multiple AI calls, external APIs, and iterative refinement. Traditional “all-in-one” AI frameworks often lock you in or can’t handle evolving requirements. **The Pocket** focuses on **human-AI co-design**: 
- **Humans** specify goals, constraints, and domain expertise.
- **AI** does the heavy lifting (workflow design, optimization, and integration).

## Pocket Features
- **Nested Directed Graph**  
  Each “node” is a simple, reusable unit. Chain them to create complex workflows like multi-agent orchestration or retrieval-augmented generation.
- **No Vendor Lock-In**  
  Integrate any LLM or API without specialized wrappers or config. 
- **Built for Debuggability**  
  Visualize workflows, add logs, handle state persistence, and incorporate human feedback loops.

## Human-AI Co-Design Flow
1. **Requirements**: Humans define tasks, success criteria, and target APIs.  
2. **System Design**: AI drafts architecture (nodes, workflows), then checks in for feedback.  
3. **Prototyping & Evaluation**: AI builds a quick prototype; humans provide sample inputs & judge outputs.  
4. **Optimization**: AI refines the system, integrates domain-specific logic, and extends components as needed.  
5. **Deployment**: AI helps write error-handling code, set up monitoring, and ensure the system runs reliably in production.

---

## Why Not Full Automation?
- **Limited Search Space**: Fully automated optimizers can’t easily handle custom tools, new APIs, or fuzzy requirements.  
- **Ambiguity is Real**: Business goals often shift mid-project. Human insight is crucial to keep AI systems on track.
