# ðŸš€ Pocketflow Framework

**The original core abstraction behind the [Pocketflow Platform](https://pocketflow.ai/)**  
Enabling nonâ€‘developers to create custom AI workflows with natural language.

## Overview

This repo contains the **original Pocketflow Framework**â€”the Nested Directed Graph engine that underpins oneâ€‘shot workflow generation on Pocketflow. Workflows on the platform wrap around this framework, providing a consistent execution model and state management layer.

We started development in November. The Python version was openâ€‘sourced in December with Zachâ€”who later spun it off as his own project. The TypeScript release followed in February.

## Why This Framework?

- **Nested Directed Graph**: Breaks complex tasks into reusable nodes with branching and recursion.  
- **Oneâ€‘Shot Assembly**: Core abstraction powering promptâ€‘based workflow creation.  

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Modular Nodes**: Each node is an independent processing unit.  
- **Vendorâ€‘Agnostic**: Integrate any LLM or API without extra wrappers.  
- **Debug-Friendly**: Inspect state and trace execution paths easily.  

## ðŸ“š Get Started
